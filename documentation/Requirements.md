## Requirements

The application should be usable as a _web app_ and use the
[twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/) methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:

+ Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project
+ Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution
  environments
+ Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
+ Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;
+ Allow to scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.

### System requirements (SR)

To ensure the success, reliability, and security of this modern web application we have this constraints : .

1. **Performance:**
    - **Response Time:** The application should provide fast response times to user actions, ensuring a smooth and
      efficient user experience.
    - **Throughput:** The system should handle a certain number of concurrent users or transactions without performance
      degradation.
    - **Scalability:** The ability to scale up or out to accommodate increased load as the user base grows (see §5).
    - **Load Handling:** The application should handle peak loads without crashing or slowing down significantly.

2. **Reliability:**
    - **Availability:** The application should be available and accessible to users as per the agreed-upon uptime
      percentage.
    - **Fault Tolerance:** The application should continue to function or gracefully degrade in the presence of
      failures.
    - **Recovery:** The system should have mechanisms to recover from failures, including data backups and disaster
      recovery plans.

3. **Security:**
    - **Authentication and Authorization:** Only authorized users should have access to specific features and data
      using [JSON Web Tokens : JWT-RFC 7519](https://jwt.io/).
    - **Data Protection:** Sensitive data should be safeguarded through access controls.
    - **Vulnerability Management:** Regular identification, assessment, and mitigation of potential security
      vulnerabilities (via APi Gateway or Service Mesh).

4. **Usability:**
    - **User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX):** The application's UI should be intuitive, user-friendly, and
      responsive across devices.
    - **Accessibility:** The application should be usable by people with disabilities, conforming to accessibility
      standards.

5. **Scalability:**
    - **Horizontal and Vertical Scaling:** The ability to add more resources (horizontal scaling) and increase resource
      capacity (vertical scaling) as needed.
    - **Elasticity:** The system should automatically scale based on load, optimizing resource utilization.

6. **Maintainability:**
    - **Modularity and Extensibility:** The application's architecture should be modular, allowing new features without
      affecting other parts.
    - **Code Quality:** Well-structured, documented code adhering to standards for easier understanding and maintenance.
    - **Version Control:** Use of version control systems to track changes and facilitate collaboration.

7. **Interoperability:**
    - **APIs and Integration:** The application should seamlessly integrate with other systems through well-defined
      APIs.
    - **Compatibility:** The application should work across browsers, devices, and operating systems.

8. **Performance Efficiency:**
    - **Resource Utilization:** Efficient use of system resources (CPU, memory, network) to avoid bottlenecks and ensure
      optimal performance.
    - **Caching:** Effective use of caching mechanisms to reduce backend load and improve response times.

9. **Compliance:**
    - **Regulatory and Legal Requirements:** The application should comply with industry regulations and legal
      standards.

10. **Operational and Support:**
    - **Monitoring and Logging:** Robust monitoring and logging mechanisms to track application health, performance, and
      issues.
    - **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation for developers, administrators, and users to aid troubleshooting
      and usage.
